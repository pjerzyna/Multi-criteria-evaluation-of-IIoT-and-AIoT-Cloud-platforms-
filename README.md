# Multi-Criteria Evaluation of Cloud Platforms for IIoT and AIoT in Automated Greenhouse Agriculture

## Overview
In the era of increasing automation in agriculture, selecting the right cloud platform for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is crucial for optimizing greenhouse management. This project evaluates and compares various cloud platforms based on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods implemented in MATLAB, including TOPSIS GT, RSM, and MREF.

## Project Scope
This project aims to:
- **Collect Data**: Gather information on cloud platforms, including functionality, cost, and integration capabilities.
- **Implement Algorithms**: Develop and modify MCDM algorithms, incorporating fuzzy logic to manage uncertainty.
- **Develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provide an intuitive interface for data input, algorithm selection, and result visualization.
- **Analyze and Compare**: Rank platforms based on criteria such as integration with autonomous robots, environmental monitoring, and cost efficiency.

## Key Features
### **Algorithms Implemented**
- **TOPSIS GT**: An extension of the classic TOPSIS method, incorporating group decision-making and fuzzy logic.
- **RSM (Reference Set Method)**: Identifies alternatives closest to reference points representing optimal criteria combinations.
- **MREF (Multi-Criteria Reference Point Approach)**: Evaluates alternatives using multiple reference points for a comprehensive analysis.

### **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
- **Data Import**: Supports importing data from Excel files.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Enables users to choose from multiple decision-making methods.
- **Result Visualization**: Displays rankings and allows comparison across different methods.

### **Analysis and Comparison**
- **Platform Evaluation**: Compares platforms such as CloudVision, Siemens MindSphere, and Azure IoT.
- **Criteria Assessment**: Evaluates platforms based on integration, cost, support, and functionalities specific to greenhouse agriculture.

## Results
The project identifies the most suitable cloud platforms for automated greenhouse agriculture, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Notably:
- **Davra IoT Platform** and **CloudVision (Sercom)** are recommended for their advanced integration and analytical capabilities.
- **Universal platforms** like **OVHcloud** and **Everyware IoT** are found to be less suited due to a lack of specialized features.

## Installation & Usage
### **Prerequisites**
- MATLAB installed with necessary toolboxes.
- Git installed (for cloning the repository).

### **Setup Instructions**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pjerzyna/Multi-criteria-evaluation-of-IIoT-and-AIoT-Cloud-platforms.git
